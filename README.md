# Final javascript challenge

Devto replicata is my final challenge as part of the JavaScript module in the Kodemia bootcamp. This project aims to replicate the DevTo website, mainly using technologies such as HTML, CSS, as well as their integrations using SCSS, also using JavaScript, to interact with the interface. It integrates with a schema within Firebase where the information entered is stored. This project was done in collaboration with different coworkers, the original repository is located at "https://github.com/NSOrtiz/DesafioJS_g33"

## Features

- **Javascript functions:** They are designed to help us interact with the dom, with an interactive approach.
- **CSS preprocessor:** Uses scass for a more concise syntax and its ability to generate cleaner and more organized CSS.
- **Firebase Integration:** Offers managed infrastructure powered by Google Cloud.
- **Collaborative work:** using principles of an agile methodology with scrum for the organization.
- **HTML and CSS:** focused for responsive design.
